Terminal Cancer
---------------
A name I thought up just now.
Pending changing it, but I don't see anyone besides me using this.
Written over the course of several years (and re-written once due to wanting async support).
This project was initially part of a chatango client script, but the display capabilities
have been segregated into this project.
